 There is problem with making a bootable USB stick installer, been like that for 7 months now and Apple seem reluctant to do anything about it.

Usually the error reported is that Volumes/<USBName> is an invalid mount point, your error is different.



Have you downloaded the most recent version of Sierra available from here,

How to upgrade to macOS Sierra - Apple Support

at Section 4 you download InstallOS.dmg which you open to InstallOS.pkg.

Double-clicking on the InstallOS.pkg will open an installation window, this does not

install Sierra but creates Install macOS Sierra.app in your Applications folder.



With Install macOS Sierra.app in the Applications folder open Terminal and copy and paste this



 sudo plutil -replace CFBundleShortVersionString -string "12.6.03" /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app/Contents/Info.plist


press Return

enter your password

press Return



now enter the createinstallmedia command for Sierra in Terminal (MyVolume is Apples default name for a USB but you can enter the name of your USB in there.



sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app 


press Return and follow the prompts.



If you still end up with an error can you post a screenshot of your Terminal window.
